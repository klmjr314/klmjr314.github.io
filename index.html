              Do you believe a picture is worth a thousand words? If so what does this one tell you? The picture you see was one of our weekly outings to the science center. I am not sure if you can’t tell, however I was eight years old and was over the idea of the picture eager to get inside (I am on the far right). As far back as I can remember I have been drawn to technology. At one point, I thought it must be a guy thing. Then I met some guys who had no technological inclination whatsoever. Instead I decided it must run in my family, only to witness my father and uncles royally destroy a fresh install of the latest Microsoft OS. Needless to say, I decided that day in Arkansas my technological savvy was all mine, and maybe a few other select humans. I also remember the first Christmas I got something worth noting, a Sega Genesis. Really, my dad got one and said that he would let me play it. I guess I realized shortly after that I was not a normal child. See, I was excited about the Sega but not for the reasons you would assume. I remember thinking I can’t wait till I can take it apart, I wonder if I should use a screw driver or a butter knife. Shortly after that I inherited my first computer. Mom got an upgrade, had me configure it for her, and the computer was my reward. That was a game changer for me because in that space I learned all sorts of things. In that laundry list some key items were the basics of upgrading both hardware and software. This was the very first time I had ever seen script. It was intriguing albeit completely cryptic to me. With the emergence of myspace and the internet explosion of html pages I was hooked living from one embedded tag to the other. With high school came puberty and well, I had some catching up to do. My life became consumed with everything from church to sports, to trying to understand the mind of teenage girls… eighteen years later and, let’s just say, that child has finally moved out. So, after completing college, serving in the military, starting a family, and a full spectrum of opportunist career moves, I am back to my first.

              Jack wants to be a master.
            </h3>
              <p class="titleT">
              Dad told me often and at least 5 times a day,” A jack of all trades is a master of none. I believed that for some time… ok maybe just long enough for me to leave home. As of late I find myself agreeing with it to some degree, however I am prone to follow all the branches of a tree and not just one. Once I started my journey of learning to code, I started with a book, which lead to several websites, and even more podcast, meetups, and research on which school would teach me what I wanted to know. I even came seconds from signing up for a boot camp, that would have undoubtable left me with more questions than answers. After tons of research and a bit of souls searching, I have settled on starting at start, web development. So far, I have become somewhat masterful with HTML, CSS, and I am becoming stronger with JavaScript. I also have sampled java, python, and have a plan to learn C++ C# along with a list of other languages that will allow me to create. I have attended classes majority online with Coursera, Udemy, watch and code, and Freecodecamp.com. While I am far from mastery I believe part of this journey is surrounding yourself with people who know more, at the same time contributing efficiently in what you already know.
